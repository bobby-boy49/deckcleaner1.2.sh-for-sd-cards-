# deckcleaner1.2.sh for SD Cards!
A quick and dirty fix to get early sd card support for deck cleaner 1.2


WARNING! THIS ONLY WORKS WITH SD CARDS DON'T USE THIS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP USING THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY! USE VERSION 1.1 FOR DEFAULT!
GET IT HERE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiaPepsi/DeckCleaner/main/deckcleaner1.1.sh



Just open "deckcleaner1.2.sh" click on "move shadercache to SD card" wait for a message to appear saying "shadercache folder was sucessfully moved to the SD card" and you are done!



Now your "shadercache" is on the sd card and can be "cleared" through the User Interface
